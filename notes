Prerequisites:
Ensure you have an AWS account and necessary permissions.
Set up a GitHub repository for your web application's source code.
Set up accounts on Jenkins, New Relic, and Terraform Cloud.

Configure Jenkins:
Install Jenkins on a server or use a cloud-based Jenkins service.
Set up necessary plugins such as Git and Docker.
Configure Jenkins with your AWS credentials to enable deployment.

Set up a Jenkins pipeline:
Create a Jenkins pipeline using Jenkinsfile or Jenkins job DSL.
Define stages in the pipeline, such as build, test, and deploy.
Use the Git plugin to clone your web application's source code from the GitHub repository.

Build and test:
Define build steps to build your Docker image.
Run unit tests, integration tests, or any other required tests.
Utilize tools like New Relic for application performance monitoring and error tracking.

Artifact management:
Publish the Docker image to a container registry (e.g., Amazon ECR).
Tag the image with a version or commit ID for traceability.

Infrastructure as Code with Terraform:
Set up Terraform configuration files to define your AWS infrastructure.
Define resources such as EC2 instances, load balancers, and security groups.
Use Terraform Cloud to manage state and perform deployments securely.

Deploy with Terraform:
Define a Terraform deployment step in your Jenkins pipeline.
Configure Terraform to provision the required infrastructure on AWS.
Pull the Docker image from the container registry and deploy it to the provisioned instances.

Continuous Monitoring:
Integrate New Relic with your deployed application for monitoring.
Configure New Relic agents to collect performance data and send it to New Relic's platform.
Monitor application health, performance, and errors through New Relic's dashboard.

Test and validate the deployment:
Perform smoke tests or additional tests to ensure the deployed application is functioning correctly.
Verify that New Relic is correctly monitoring the application.

Enable automatic triggering:
Configure webhook or trigger-based integrations between GitHub and Jenkins.
Set up triggers for the pipeline to automatically start on code changes or pull requests.
